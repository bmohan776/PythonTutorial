Create a Virtual Environment
Python Azure Functions App requires that you work within a virtual environment. If you are unfamiliar with using venv, there is a great primer over at RealPython.

Bash (MacOS or Linux)

`python3.6 -m venv .env`
`source .env/bin/activate`

PowerShell or Command Prompt (Windows)
py -3.6 -m venv .env

`.\.env\Scripts\activate`


Initialize Your Azure Function App
Execute the following command to create a new Function App:

`func init encryption_and_decryption`

There is now a folder called encryption_and_decryption with the boilerplate code for a Python Azure Function App. If you would like, take some time to open the code in your favorite editor and have a look around.



Create the encrypt Function
Make sure you are in the encryption_and_decryption directory:
`cd encryption_and_decryption`
Create the new function using:
`func new`

At the prompt, choose HTTP trigger. Then name the function encrypt.

Encrypting Input
Open the file encrypt/__init__.py. You should see boilerplate code for an HTTP trigger function. This function will take name as a parameter and return "Hello name!". Let's add code at the bottom of this file that will instead encrypt the name using a random set of token bytes.
